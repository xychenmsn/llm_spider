Why the State Machine Doesn't Proceed Automatically
Missing State Transitions: The log file shows that the system successfully transitions to state S2 (FETCHING_HTML) and fetches the HTML content, but there's no evidence of a transition to state S3 (ANALYZING_CONTENT) or beyond. This indicates that the state transitions are not happening automatically.
LLM Not Using Function Calls: The LLM is not making the necessary function calls to the parse_webpage function that would trigger state transitions. The parse_webpage function is designed to handle state transitions based on the current state and action, but it's not being called by the LLM.
Missing <state> Tags: The LLM responses don't include the <state> tags that would trigger state transitions in the code. The _process_memory_operations method in parser_designer.py is designed to process these tags, but they're not being generated by the LLM.
User Interaction Required: The state machine appears to be designed to require user interaction to progress through the states. The LLM is waiting for user input to confirm actions or provide additional information before proceeding to the next state.
Function Call Mechanism: The parse_webpage function is available to the LLM through the function schemas, but the LLM is not using it to trigger state transitions. This could be due to:
The LLM not being properly instructed to use function calls
The LLM not understanding when to use the function calls
The function call mechanism not being properly integrated with the state machine
Missing Automatic Progression Logic: There doesn't appear to be any code that automatically progresses the state machine without user input. The state transitions are triggered either by user input or by function calls from the LLM, but there's no automatic progression mechanism.
Solution Recommendations
To make the state machine proceed to create a parser by itself, you would need to:
Enhance LLM Prompting: Update the system prompt to explicitly instruct the LLM to use function calls to progress through the state machine without waiting for user input.
Add Automatic State Progression: Modify the code to automatically progress to the next state after certain operations complete successfully. For example, after fetching HTML, automatically transition to analyzing content.
Implement State Transition Hooks: Add hooks in the code that trigger the next state transition after successful completion of the current state's actions.
Use Function Calls Consistently: Ensure the LLM consistently uses function calls to interact with the state machine, particularly the parse_webpage function with appropriate state and action parameters.
Add Default Actions: Implement default actions for each state that are executed automatically if no user input is provided within a certain timeframe.
The core issue appears to be that while the state machine logic is well-defined, the mechanism for automatically progressing through the states without user intervention is not implemented or not working correctly.
